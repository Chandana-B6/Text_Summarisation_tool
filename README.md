It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sometimes Machine Learning (ML) to understand the text and create a shorter version.

There are two main types:

Extractive Summarization

Picks important sentences or phrases directly from the original text.

It does not change the wordsâ€”just selects the most important parts.

Abstractive Summarization

Understands the full meaning of the text.

Rewrites it in new words, just like how humans summarize.

More advanced, often uses AI models like GPT.
